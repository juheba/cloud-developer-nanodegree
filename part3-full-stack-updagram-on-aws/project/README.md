# Github Project
https://github.com/juheba/cloud-developer-nanodegree/tree/master
* master and dev branch
* master contains the up to date code
* Udagram-Server: https://github.com/juheba/cloud-developer-nanodegree/tree/master/part3-full-stack-updagram-on-aws/exercises/udacity-c2-restapi
* Filter-Server: https://github.com/juheba/cloud-developer-nanodegree/tree/master/part3-full-stack-updagram-on-aws/project/image-filter-starter-code
* Both servers can be started with `npm run dev`
* The project was deployed using the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI `eb init`, `eb create`, and `eb deploy` commands. See provided screenshots in deployment_screenshot directory.

# Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
* ✅ Refactor the project built in the course to make a request to this project service upon image upload
  * Udagram-Server: https://github.com/juheba/cloud-developer-nanodegree/tree/master/part3-full-stack-updagram-on-aws/exercises/udacity-c2-restapi got a new Endpoint /api/v0/feed/:id/filtered
  * the Endpoint needs a valid JWT Token as auth header
  * sends the imageurl of the provided feed by id to the Filter Service and returns the filtered image as base64 data url
  * Additional, but not that perfect:
    * Udagram-Frontend: https://github.com/juheba/cloud-developer-nanodegree/tree/master/part3-full-stack-updagram-on-aws/exercises/udacity-c2-frontend has an button on each feed to get a filtered version of the image
    * ![Frontend feed original image](doc/Udagram-Frontend-Feed.png "Displays the original image")
    * ![Frontend feed filtered image](doc/Udagram-Frontend-Feed-Filtered.png "Displays the filtered image")
    * sadly at the moment i was not able to deploy a functional frontend to the aws bucket
    * Frontend itself is accessible but /feed results in an error
    * i need to configure https to communication between frontend and backend (CORS header should be forwarded by CloudFront, but https seems to be missing)
* ✅ Add a required authentication header to block public requests
  * /filterimage needs auth informations
  * Postman Collection contains a request to get an valid auth token (the token is saved as TOKEN environment variable).
  * ![Postman post /login, response JWT Token is saved as TOKEN environment variable](doc/Postman_get-valid-token.png "JWT Token is saved as TOKEN environment variable")
  * ![Postman get /filteredImage, JWT Token is accessed via environment variable and appended as auth header to the request](doc/Postman_token-environment-variable.png "JWT Token is accessed via environment variable and appended as auth header to the request")
  * Test the authorized request someone has to trigger both requests: /login then /filteredImage
* ❌ Add your own domain name and have it point to the running services (try adding a subdomain name to point to the processing server) NOTE: Domain names are not included in AWS’ free tier and will incur a cost.

Like other students already pointed out, I've added a little error handling to the provided helper method filterImageFromURL. I'm aware that this is a modification on the provided code.

See snippet:
![filterImageFromURL Snippet with modified Code. Try-Catch Block arround Jimp.read(inputURL). On catch, reject error.](doc/try-catch-Jimp-read.png "Modified Code with added try-catch block.")
Or on github:
https://github.com/juheba/cloud-developer-nanodegree/blob/master/part3-full-stack-updagram-on-aws/project/image-filter-starter-code/src/util/util.ts#L12-L21

In server.js an rejected error from filterImageFromURL is catched and results in a 422 response with the error.
